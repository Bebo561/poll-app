## Techstack

Technologies used: MERN stack, Bcryptjs, Mongoose, Axios

## Purpose
The purpose of this project, as stated in the about section is to simply introduce myself to programming with react. I am already familiar with producing websites in the node environment, particularly with handling simple REST APIs made with express. I decided it would be a fun, fulfilling, and educational project to build a fullstack website from scratch. React will be used for the frontend client side, and an expressjs server will be used to handle the database storage of user inputted information such as their username and password.

## Overview
This goal of this project is to be a webpage where users can register their accounts, sign in to their accounts, and then access a homepage where they can create a custom voting form. This voting form will have a header of what the vote is about, as well as a list of possible items to vote for, maximum of 3. The user will only be allowed to vote once per poll, and the percentage of votes for each item.

## Updates
Surpirse final update to the project that has finally made it truly fullstack by adding a true mongoDB database. All interactions with the mongoDB database are handled through the help of Mongoose, a javascript library that simplifies accessing and inserting queries in a mongoDB database. I have not only updated the backend to retain all of its previous functionality concerning updating, inserting, and deleting data, but have also finally fixed the error in the homepage where users must refresh the homepage if they delete the final poll or else the final poll will still appear as availible. Overall, this was a very enjoyable and educational website project, I have gained so much knowledge in insight on the process of developing websites from an empty webpage to full application. This project has not only inspired me to keep on creating more and improving my skills, but also finally start applying for jobs as I feel as I finally have proven to myself that I have true potential as a professional web developer.
