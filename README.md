# Techstack

Current technologies used: Reactjs, CSS, Nodejs, Expressjs, Axios
Planned technologies: bcryptjs to safetly store user passwords.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project, as stated in the about section is to simply introduce myself to programming with react. I am already familiar with producing websites in the node environment, particularly with handling simple REST APIs made with express. I decided it would be a fun, fulfilling, and educational project to build a fullstack website from scratch. React will be used for the frontend client side, and an expressjs server will be used to handle the database storage of user inputted information such as their username and password.

## Overview
This goal of this project is to be a webpage where users can register their accounts, sign in to their accounts, and then access a homepage where they can create a custom voting form. This voting form will have a header of what the vote is about, as well as a list of possible items to vote for, maximum of 5. The user will only be allowed to vote once per poll, and the percentage of votes for each item.

## Updates
This project is almost completely done, as most of the features intended to be added are already up and running. The login and register features both work fully as intended, as well as the creation of a poll, and the homepage where users can place their votes. As of right now, I am aware of the error that users can place multiple votes in the same poll by simply refreshing the page, but as of now I simply want to wrap up the project as school starts up again soon. The final features that I intend to release for this project are bcryptjs as stated above, as well as logout function, a delete function for polls, and a dropdown menu that shows a users account in the homepage. All code is public and can be viewed in their respective folders.
